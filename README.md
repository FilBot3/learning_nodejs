## References

The libraries, or NPM packages uses were fround at
[NPM JS.org](https://npmjs.org).

[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) is where the runtime and documentation is held.
Mostly this is API related, not specifically the language. The language is
JavaScirpt, which can be learned anywhere. Then after that, import your module
into a variable and call as usual.

Learning more about NodeJS and JavaScript at
[NodeSchool.io](https://nodeschool.io) is a great help as well. 

Then just mostly Google searching around.
